# Hotel Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data using **SQL** for data extraction, transformation, and analysis, and **Power BI** for visualization. The goal is to uncover insights related to **booking trends, customer behavior, revenue analysis, and hotel occupancy patterns**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Clean & preprocess** hotel booking data using SQL.
- **Analyze trends** in occupancy, revenue, and customer segments.
- **Visualize data** using interactive Power BI dashboards.
- **Derive insights** to improve business decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL** (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server) – Data transformation & queries.
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation & visualization.
- **Excel** – Data preprocessing.

## 📊 Key Analysis Areas
1. **Booking Trends** - Identify peak seasons, stay durations, and popular hotel types.
2. **Revenue & Occupancy** - Calculate occupancy rates, revenue, and customer spending.
